Variational Quantum Optimization for Distributed Resource Scheduling

Here, I want to show how we can develop a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to optimize the allocation of computational resources in a distributed system, minimizing energy consumption and job latency.



1. Problem Formulation:
Defining a scheduling problem for assigning computational jobs to distributed nodes with constraints like energy consumption, bandwidth, and latency.

2. Mathematical Modeling:
Representing the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and mapping it to an Ising Hamiltonian.

3. Variational Quantum Algorithm:
Designing a parameterized quantum circuit to encode the problem and using a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to find the optimal configuration.

4. Classical Optimization:
Selecting classical optimizers (e.g., COBYLA or SPSA) for training quantum parameters.

5. Simulation and Testing:
Simulating the algorithm on a quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit or Pennylane) with synthetic datasets of jobs and grid nodes.

6. Visualization:
Comparing classical-only scheduling methods with hybrid quantum-classical results, presenting metrics like execution time, energy efficiency, and optimization quality.

7. Extension:
Testing with real-world distributed systems data which is not available for me!
